🧑‍💻 About Me<br/>

I’m a passionate frontend developer focused on building seamless, efficient, and user-centered applications. With a strong foundation in front-end technologies, I love crafting interactive user interfaces, enhancing user experiences, and staying up-to-date with the latest in web development. Additionally, I bring knowledge of backend development with Python and Flask, along with experience in databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
